# CSE591 - Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange overview
The Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol (1976) was the first
practical method for establishing a shared secret over an unsecured
communication channel.
The point is to agree on a key that two parties can use for a
symmetric encryption, in such a way that an eavesdropper cannot
obtain the key.

# (1) the problem, i.e., what's given and what's wanted for your project

# (2) the method that you use to solve the problem
# (3) the implementation of the method 
# (4) the results, including the runs and tests you performed, with resulting numbers, plots, graphs, etc. Each part should also include brief justifications for why you did what you did.

Your final handin should include a project report, that describes (1) the problem, i.e., what's given and what's wanted for your project, (2) the method that you use to solve the problem, (3) the implementation of the method, and (4) the results, including the runs and tests you performed, with resulting numbers, plots, graphs, etc. Each part should also include brief justifications for why you did what you did.
